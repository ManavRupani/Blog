The all new LPCAMM2 looks nothing like the previous upgradeable Rams, looks stunning 
The best thing is that is smaller and consumes less power which can be very helpful in the future design of laptops small RAM means more space for GPU and other modules and less power consumption  means more power for other modules  possibilities are endless 


### My take on this new hardware
In my opinion, the new RAM will solve a lot of problems regarding the space available on notebooks, and high-end laptops which focus on thinner designs It will be very easy to have vapour camber and 5090 on laptops without any headache open door for NPUs will also see what framework laptops have to offer on this
